# 🔗 Leads Tracker App

A clean and intuitive web/mobile app to save, manage, and delete your favorite links—built with Firebase Realtime Database and crafted with AO-style clarity by Devendra.

## 🌟 Overview

This app allows users to:

- ✅ Save custom URLs to a cloud database
- ✅ Prevent duplicate entries
- ✅ Block empty submissions
- ✅ Delete leads one-by-one or all at once
- ✅ View saved links across devices (mobile & desktop)
